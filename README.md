# SITTSM-Mods

My mods use BepInEx5, [installation instructions](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html).

To install one of my mod, extract the zip content in the base game folder where `Stick It To The Stickman.exe` is located.

## You Can't Fire Me I Quit

This mod skip the scene where Thumby tells you you are fired when you want to quit the game.

*The zip is inside `YouCantFireMeIQuit/` folder.*
